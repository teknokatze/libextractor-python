Python bindings for GNU libextractor

About libextractor
==================

 libextractor is a simple library for keyword extraction.  libextractor
 does not support all formats but supports a simple plugging mechanism
 such that you can quickly add extractors for additional formats, even
 without recompiling libextractor. libextractor typically ships with a
 dozen helper-libraries that can be used to obtain keywords from common
 file-types.  

 libextractor is a part of the GNU project (http://www.gnu.org/).

Performances
============

 Surprisingly the original C native library is only 20% faster than
 this python ctypes bindings. Here a quick and dirty bench:
  
 The C extract on Extractor test files:

 $ time `find Extractor/test -type f -not -name "*.svn*"|xargs extract`
   
  real    0m0.403s
  user    0m0.303s
  sys     0m0.061s

 Same data with the ctypes python bindings:

 $ time `find Extractor/test -type f -not -name "*.svn*"|xargs extract.py`
   
  real    0m0.661s
  user    0m0.529s
  sys     0m0.074s
