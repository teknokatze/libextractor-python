This is the python binding for libextractor.

Actually, there are two bindings in this package.
One written by Heiko Wundram (abandoned) and
another one drafted by Bader Lejmi (extractor.py).

Also note that there is a third binding for both
libextractor and doodle by nokos, available at
http://gnunet.org/libextractor/download/

I have no idea which is best at this time.
